# Example of Using Asynchronous Programming (Async) and Multiprocessing

This repository contains examples of using asynchronous programming (Async) and multiprocessing in Python. The examples demonstrate how to make asynchronous and parallel calls to web APIs and services.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following requirements installed in your development environment:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## File 1: main_async.py

This file demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming (Async) to make asynchronous calls to multiple functions. The file utilizes the `asyncio` module to handle coroutines and the `aiohttp` module to make asynchronous calls to web APIs.

## File 2: main_multiprocessing.py

This file demonstrates the use of multiprocessing in Python to make parallel calls to multiple functions. The file utilizes the `multiprocessing` module to create independent processes and make the calls in parallel.

## Functions Used:

All functions used are in functions_async.py and functions_multiprocessing.py

## Execution and Results

To run each example, just run the respective Python file (main_async.py or main_multiprocessing.py). The results and the time the calls took from the calls will be displayed on the console.
